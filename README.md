## Projects
### Code Review
This code review involves analyzing my projects to identify strengths and areas for improvement in structure, logic, security, efficiency, and documentation. It ensures the code follows best practices and prepares it for enhancements or real-world use.

### Virtual Workspace – A Real-Time 3D Scene Built with OpenGL
This project is a real-time 3D rendering of a bedroom desk scene built using C++, OpenGL, and GLSL. It features interactive camera controls, multiple lighting types, and realistic textures using color, normal, and roughness maps. The code was modularized and refactored to improve performance, readability, and visual fidelity through physically-based rendering techniques.

### Encryption-Decryption Project
This C++ project is a console-based application that performs symmetric encryption and decryption using the XOR bitwise operation. It reads input from a text file, encrypts the content using a user-defined key, saves the encrypted result to a new file, then decrypts that encrypted data and saves it again for verification. To ensure the accuracy of the process, the program includes a file comparison feature that checks if the decrypted output exactly matches the original input.

### Python CRUD Project
This project is a web-based dashboard application that connects to a MongoDB database to manage animal shelter records. It allows users to create, read, update, and delete animal data through a Python-powered backend, while the frontend—built using Dash and Plotly—displays interactive tables, charts, and geolocation maps. The system is designed to help organizations quickly filter and visualize adoptable animals based on specific rescue mission needs.
