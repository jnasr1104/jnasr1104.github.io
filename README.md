### Virtual Workspace – A Real-Time 3D Scene Built with OpenGL
### Narrative
This artifact is a 3D rendered scene made from CPP and OpenGL graphics that directly resembles my at home desk. It was created in June of 2024.
This enhanced 3D scene project is included in my ePortfolio as a key artifact that demonstrates my technical abilities in software development, graphics programming, and software engineering principles. I selected this project because it is a comprehensive representation of my ability to work with modern OpenGL, apply modular code architecture, and implement real-time rendering techniques such as lighting, material systems, and texture mapping.
I successfully met the course outcomes I planned to achieve through this enhancement. Specifically, this project allowed me to demonstrate how I applied modular design practices by refactoring large and tightly coupled code into organized, maintainable components. This included breaking down monolithic rendering logic, encapsulating global variables, and improving documentation throughout the codebase.
The process of enhancing and modifying this 3D scene artifact was both challenging and rewarding. It allowed me to revisit my earlier work with a more critical and experienced perspective, applying new skills and insights I’ve gained throughout the course. One of the most valuable aspects of this process was learning how to refactor and improve an existing codebase without disrupting its core functionality. I had to carefully identify areas of the code that could be modularized, reorganized, or improved for better readability, performance, and maintainability. This experience reinforced the importance of clean code structure and consistent commenting, especially when working on larger software systems.
One of the biggest challenges I encountered was resolving texture loading issues and ensuring that each object was properly linked to its corresponding material and shader data. Troubleshooting these problems required careful debugging, testing, and fine-tuning the structure of the shader and texture-loading functions. However, overcoming these challenges helped me become more confident in my problem-solving abilities and my understanding of low-level graphics programming.

Enhancements done include:
Realistic textures on desk, wall, keyboard, mouse, bottle etc.
Implemented 4 legs to the desk matching the Oak wood texture of the desk
Expanded the planes to improve the view and visibility of the scene
Added more thorough comments on MainCode.cpp, ViewManager.cpp, and SceneManager.cpp
Made code more organized and easier to read
Got rid of unnecessary code while keeping same functionality (ViewManager.cpp cut down to 166 lines from approximately 300).

### Encryption-Decryption Project
### Narrative

I selected the encryption-decryption program for inclusion in my ePortfolio because it clearly showcases my skills in algorithm design, data structure usage, and secure data handling. This artifact highlights a fundamental concept in computer science — symmetric encryption using the XOR bitwise operation — and reflects my ability to implement efficient, logical solutions in C++. Throughout the enhancement process, I improved the original program by modularizing the code into clear, reusable functions, such as encrypt_decrypt, read_file, write_file, and compare_files. I also added robust error handling, implemented file validation logic to confirm the success of encryption and decryption, and significantly improved the clarity of the code through enhanced commenting and structure. These refinements made the program more maintainable, professional, and scalable.
This project allowed me to meet several of the learning outcomes I set for myself in Module One. Specifically, I demonstrated my ability to apply algorithms to real-world problems, work with file input/output in C++, and organize code using modular practices. I do not have any updates to my outcome-coverage plan, as this enhancement aligns closely with the goals I originally identified. Through the process of modifying and refining this artifact, I deepened my understanding of how bitwise operations like XOR can be leveraged for data transformation, and I gained valuable insight into file handling and verification strategies in C++. One of the challenges I encountered was ensuring the program handled file errors gracefully and comparing the decrypted file to the original with accuracy. Debugging file access issues and ensuring binary integrity during read/write operations also pushed me to think critically about edge cases.
Overall, this enhancement reinforced my technical abilities and taught me the importance of writing clean, testable, and defensively programmed code. It also gave me a solid foundation for building more complex systems involving data security and file processing in the future.

### Python CRUD Project
### Narrative
This project is a data-driven dashboard application that integrates a MongoDB database with an interactive frontend built using Dash and Plotly. It enables users to manage animal shelter records through create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations, while visualizing the data with sortable tables, breed-based pie charts, and interactive geolocation maps. As part of the enhancement process, I significantly improved the backend CRUD module by modernizing it with insert_one, update_many, and delete_many methods, adding robust input validation, and implementing structured exception handling to ensure data integrity and operational reliability. I also transitioned the system from a cloud-hosted MongoDB instance to a locally hosted setup, making it more practical for real-world deployment and testing.

On the frontend, I enhanced the dashboard’s layout and interactivity, introducing error-safe filtering logic, responsive UI elements, and modular callbacks that dynamically update the displayed data. These changes ensure a seamless user experience when searching for animals suited for specific rescue operations. Through this project, I demonstrated skills in full-stack software development, including database integration, secure backend logic, responsive frontend design, and data visualization. The enhancements directly align with course outcomes such as designing scalable, maintainable software, implementing data-centric systems, and applying real-world problem-solving strategies using industry-standard tools. This project showcases my ability to build end-to-end applications that are robust, user-friendly, and professionally structured.
