## Professional Self-Assessment
My name is Jason Nasr, and I am a dedicated Computer Science student with a strong foundation in software engineering, full-stack development, and systems thinking. My academic and project-based work has consistently demonstrated my ability to develop practical and innovative solutions, leveraging both my technical and analytical skills. This self-assessment outlines my growth as a developer and highlights how the enhancements made to my capstone artifacts reflect my technical proficiency, problem-solving mindset, and commitment to continuous improvement.

Throughout my portfolio, I have showcased three enhanced artifacts that reflect a range of technical competencies: an interactive CRUD web application using Python and MongoDB, an encryption/decryption program in C++ focused on file handling and security, and a 3D computational graphics scene developed in C++ with OpenGL. Each project has been revisited with a focus on performance, readability, maintainability, and visual or functional improvements. These enhancements allowed me to not only apply feedback from code reviews but also adopt best practices in areas such as modular design, error handling, defensive programming, and user experience.

In my CRUD dashboard project, I reinforced my backend development skills by optimizing database interactions, integrating filtering features, and improving data validation. My encryption program reflects my understanding of algorithms and secure file handling, enhanced with robust commenting, better modular structure, and error-checking. My 3D graphics scene demonstrates my growth in low-level rendering, shader optimization, and object-oriented design, with a significant focus on improving both the code structure and visual fidelity of the scene.

These projects serve as quantifiable proof of my ability to independently identify opportunities for improvement, implement thoughtful enhancements, and deliver high-quality code. They also reflect my proficiency in Python, C++, OpenGL, database management, and modern software engineering principles. I selected these artifacts for my ePortfolio because they each represent a different aspect of software development—from back-end systems to user-facing experiences—and together, they showcase my versatility and depth as a developer.

My ePortfolio is not just a collection of projects—it is a curated reflection of my journey as a software engineer. It communicates my technical capabilities, growth mindset, and ability to deliver solutions that are both functional and maintainable. As I continue to evolve professionally, I aim to build upon this foundation with a focus on cloud technologies, scalable systems, and emerging trends in AI and cybersecurity.

## Projects
### Code Review
This code review involves analyzing my projects to identify strengths and areas for improvement in structure, logic, security, efficiency, and documentation. It ensures the code follows best practices and prepares it for enhancements or real-world use.

### Virtual Workspace – A Real-Time 3D Scene Built with OpenGL
#### Narrative
This project is a real-time 3D rendering of a bedroom desk scene built using C++, OpenGL, and GLSL. It features interactive camera controls, multiple lighting types, and realistic textures using color, normal, and roughness maps. The code was modularized and refactored to improve performance, readability, and visual fidelity through physically-based rendering techniques.

### Encryption-Decryption Project
This C++ project is a console-based application that performs symmetric encryption and decryption using the XOR bitwise operation. It reads input from a text file, encrypts the content using a user-defined key, saves the encrypted result to a new file, then decrypts that encrypted data and saves it again for verification. To ensure the accuracy of the process, the program includes a file comparison feature that checks if the decrypted output exactly matches the original input.

### Python CRUD Project
This project is a web-based dashboard application that connects to a MongoDB database to manage animal shelter records. It allows users to create, read, update, and delete animal data through a Python-powered backend, while the frontend—built using Dash and Plotly—displays interactive tables, charts, and geolocation maps. The system is designed to help organizations quickly filter and visualize adoptable animals based on specific rescue mission needs.
